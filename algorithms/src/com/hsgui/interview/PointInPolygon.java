 *    This rule determines the "insideness" of a point on the canvas by
 *    drawing a ray from that point to infinity in any direction and
 *    counting the number of path segments from the given shape that the ray crosses.
 *    If this number is odd, the point is inside;
 *    if even, the point is outside.

## spirit of metaprogramming
**All in one, template metaprogramming is all about types and works in compile time**.

Normally, programmers write code that is compiled and does something at run-time. While metaprogrammars write code that generates code at complile-time. Metaprogrammers use **metafunctions** to describe the code that generates code. That is, a function that takes types or non-type parameters as parameters and return a new type.

Template metaprogramming consists in **using the C++ template system to generate C++ types, and C++ code at compile-time**. A template function or class is not a function or class at all. It's a template to generate functions or classes. After instantiating the template with some types as argument, we get a new type or instance.

Take *std::vector* as an example. std::vector is not a class, is a template. We can instantiate std::vector with different element types to get new types. *`std::vector<int>`* is a new class type, *`std::vector<string>`* is another new class type, *`std::vector<double>`* is another new. These three new class types are generated by compiler at compile-time according to the *`std::vector`* template and managed internally by the compiler.

As metaprogramming, we actually work with C++ type system, using types as values for our computations. What's more, template metaprogramming works like a *functional programming language*. Because metafunctions have no side effect: **we can only create new types, not to modify existing ones**.

## Template parameters
C++ templates can take three kinds of parameters: **Value parameters**, **type parameters**, and **template template parameter**.

### value parameters
For value parameters, C++ templates can only take parameters that are integral values known at compile time.
